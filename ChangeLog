	* 2.3.0 release

	* New Features
	
	- IEEE 802.3 Support
	- Support for reading from the Berkeley Packet Filter, resulting in lower jitter
	- Configuration file support, multiple previously unsupported options
	- Rewritten command line parameter handling, new parameters
	- Command line options to print default configuration, print lock file,	check configuration and more,
	- Full help (-H) for all configuration options,
	- Configuration reload support with SIGHUP,
	- Rewritten logging subsystem, 
	- Separate log file and statistics file, SIGHUP reprints the headers
  	- Support for mode and interface specific lock files
	- Network interface checks before startup and during config reload
	- Added ./configure --sigusr2=counters - will dump PTP engine countersto current log target when SIGUSR2 received
	- Support for presets - groups of PTP protocol options defining	ptpd behaviour
		presets available: slaveonly, masteronly, masterslave
	- Support for tick adjustment as well as frequency
		maximum frequency offset is now configurable and can be above 512 ppm - tick is used above 512 ppm,
	- Added a compatibility option to always honour the UTC offset announced by a GM when in slave state
	- Added an announce receipt timeout "grace period" for slave state
	  	slave can wait n times timeout without fully resetting
	  	allows a seamless failover without resetting delay values etc.,
	- Added support for DELAY_DISABLED delay mode - syntonisation only
	- Initial support for informing the clock subsystem about the sync status
		STA_UNSYNC is unset when adjusting the clock (allows syncing hardware RTC clocks with the system clock)
		also maxerror and esterror are set,
	- Support for legacy command line switches from previous versions
	- Configurable log level for normal logs, not only debug logs.
	- Generic log file handler mechanism with a simple built-in logrotate implementation
		for each log file container you can specify max size and max number of files
	- Extensive support for realtime statistics
	  	online long term statistics and moving statistics 
	  	mean and std dev. 
	  		Some new features included depend on statistics support, enabled with the --enable-statistics
	  		configure switch. Statistics rely on double precision so may be disabled for simple embedded systems
	- Outlier filters based on Peirce's criterion 
	  blocks / filters spikes from delayMS and delaySM 
	- Generic PI controler model
	- P and I components changed from attenuations to gains (scaled to 1/1000)
	- Optional double precision servo allows for tighter clock control
			configure --enable-double-servo
	- Clock stabilisation detection based on the standard dev of observed drift
	- Clock "calibration delay" 
		allows a configurable delay between seeing a GM for the first time and enabling clock control
	- Realtime statistics - mean and std dev of one-way delay, ofm and observed drift
	- Status file: one-screen dump of information about the current state of ptpd, updated in configurable intervals.
	- Support for "panic mode"
		if ptpd sees offset from master above 1 second, it will pause clock updates for a given amount of time
	- NTPd integration and failover
		ptpd can now connect to local ntpd using mode 7 packets (code derived from ntpdc)
	  	and using authenticated requests can enable/disable ntpd clock control.
	  		Enable with configure --enable-ntpdc
	- Dump counters using a SIGUSR2 handler to dump all counters to the log file
	  	configure --enable-sigusr2=counters
	  		  
	Bug fixes:
	
	- TTL no longer defaults to 64 in P2P mode - in P2P it's set to 1,
	- Fixed an issue whereby observed drift would be reset to 0 if it
	  could not be read from the drift file (empty or nonexistent drift file),
	  now the kernel value is used if read from file fails.
	 - Support for updating utmp/wtmp when stepping the clock (FR #38)
	 - Mean Path Delay filtering now done in float (patch #49)
	
	Cleanups and other changes:
	
	- Major startup.c cleanup, removed the parallel daemon checks,
	  in favour of better lock handling and the automatic lock file
	  name support,
	- Some minor refactoring,
	- Added a TimePropertiesDS structure and removed its fields
	  from PtpClock
	- Improved log file format with full date and interface name,
	  removed the "===" indents
	- Delay Request interval no longer mandatory in hybrid mode,
	  but a warning will be issued if it's not explicitly defined -
	  default of 0 is used,
	- Removed the experimental status of hybrid mode,
	- Manual stepping of the clock no longer just resets the observed
	  drift: resets it or restores it based on the drift handling setting,
	  and sets the time immediately before writing any logs - this allows
	  to re-sync and stabilise time almost instantly

	* 2.2.2 release

	* Leap second fix
	
2012-01-05  George Neville-Neil  <gnn@neville-neil.com>

	* 2.2.0 release

	* Patches: 3134556, 3296405

	* Added support for Mac OS X (tested on Snow Leopard and Lion)

	* Protocol implementation Fixes:

	* Bugs Fixed

	- Client now correctly accepts the Master DelayReq rate
	- DelayMS and delaySM now correctly show the sign when negative
	- Sanity Flags: client now requires -g or -G for slave/master operation.
	- Client can print the MAC address of its master (instead of EEUI)
	- master now sends ARB timescale only with utc_offset of zero
	- slave now only uses the last UTC_Offset if UTC_Valid bit is on.

	- first delayreq is postponed until we receive the first sync

	- delayReq period is now uniformly randomized from range
	- updated to the PTPv2 messages rates (sync / delayreq / announce )

	- Debug messages show a timestamp
	- Signals are now processed synchronously (to avoid race conditions)

	- unicast messages can use DNS
	- syslog support (-S)
	- quality file can be generated with received syncs (-R)

	- gnore packets that result in large deltas (-M)
	- SIGUSR1 now steps the clock to the current PTP offset
	- SIGUSR2 now cycles the domain number (useful for testing)
	- reverted R135 timer change from integer back to floating point
	- rand() is now seeded with last digits of our own mac address
	- IGMP_refresh waits 100ms between drop() and add()
	- checked to run without leaks inside valgrind 3.5.0
	- last message received is identified by a column on the statistics log
	- messages are sent to Syslog by default. reversed -S flag
	- statistcs file now display /etc/ethers names (besides mac address)
	- option -C is console mode with full verbosity
	- startup warnings are also duplicated in stdout
	- startup: lockfile is checked twice: once at init, to return
	  correct errorlevel, and a second time after deaemon()
	- check for root uid()
	- improvements in parallel daemons checking
	- command line parameters are dumped at init
	- Set the unicast flag when sending unicast packets
	  (experimental, hybrid mode only).

	- Reimplemented integer64_to_internalTime not to use doubles
	- Replaced divTime by div2Time
	- Replaced all time.seconds = time.nanoseconds = 0 by clearTime(&time)
	- Replaced all hex values by named flags
	- Optimized comparison of clockIdentity in bmc.c
